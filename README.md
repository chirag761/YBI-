Text Generation using Transformer Model 🧠💬
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Transformer-based language model for text generation. The notebook walks through the process of building a simple Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch and training it on a sample dataset to generate human-like text.

📌 Project Overview
The Transformer architecture has revolutionized natural language processing tasks. This project demonstrates the core concepts of the Transformer model by:

Implementing key components (multi-head attention, positional encoding, encoder-decoder blocks).

Training on a simple dataset (e.g., English text corpus).

Generating coherent sentences using greedy decoding and/or sampling.

This project is ideal for students, researchers, and developers who want to understand how text generation works under the hood using Transformers.
